# Team 97

This is a service project designed to assist visually impaired individuals by enabling a NAO robot to read books aloud. The project uses a camera to capture text, converts the text to speech, and integrates with an intelligent AI API to enable interactive Q&A.

## Features and Functionality

## Functionality

### Laptop Folder

This project leverages the laptop's built-in camera to perform various tasks, including:

- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition):** Capture images and extract text using OCR technology.
- **Reading Aloud:** Read the extracted text aloud, simulating a natural reading experience.
- **Music Playback:** Integrate with a music player to play background music while reading or during other activities.
- **Emotion-based Reading:** Enhance the reading experience by modulating the voice based on the emotional content of the text.

### Music

This section contains a curated list of music that can be played during various activities.

### NLTK Data

Use NLTK data as a training dataset for natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis and text classification, to enhance the emotion-based reading functionality.
