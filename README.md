This is a service project designed to assist visually impaired individuals by enabling a NAO robot to read books aloud. The project uses a camera to capture text, converts the text to speech, and integrates with an intelligent AI API to enable interactive Q&A.

## Features and Functionality

- **Text_Recognition Module:**
  - Captures an image using the system's camera, processes it to grayscale, and extracts text using Tesseract OCR.
  - This functionality allows the NAO robot to recognize and read aloud printed text for visually impaired individuals.
